These are code for the second project path planning.

 Credited to slides in MEAM 620 class:

 Also another version of A* is available in my github utilizing JPS3D

 https://github.com/iamliguangming/MEAM620/tree/JPS-testing

 The code still has some bug for cases with resolution too low

 The algorithm for JPS3D are credited to https://github.com/KumarRobotics/jps3d

 The original code was in C++, I rewrote it into Python code. Kinda slow in performance
